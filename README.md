This project is built using typescript for a simple form that a has a stepper. A basic stepper contains a visual form that shows the progress when you filled correctly. I also added a validation features to check the input. Of course libraries exist which can gravely simplify the process but it test your basic knowledge of form validation and manipulation and also basic validation.
Typescript which is also a superset of javascript introduces type checking for better linting and also makes your code more robust and less prone to errors.
I normally would want to go the full length of doing a basic animation using framer motion for easeins but i think Jesus will understand:).
